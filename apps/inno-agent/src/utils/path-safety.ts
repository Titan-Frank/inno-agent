/**
 * Symlink-aware path containment checks, shared by the HTTP file endpoints
 * (server/file-helpers.ts) and the agent-side workspace path guard
 * (agent/workspace-path-guard.ts).
 *
 * A purely lexical `resolve` + `relative` check is not enough for paths that
 * may contain symlinks: a symlink planted inside an allowed root (e.g. by the
 * agent's bash tool inside a workspace) lets a request escape to any file on
 * the host. The checks here resolve the closest *existing* ancestor through
 * `realpathSync` and project the non-existent suffix from there, so symlink
 * escapes are caught for both reads and writes.
 *
 * "Existing" is determined with `lstatSync`, not `existsSync`: `existsSync`
 * follows links, so a *dangling* symlink (target missing) would look like a
 * non-existent suffix and skip the realpath check — and a subsequent write
 * would follow the link and create the file outside the root. With lstat the
 * symlink itself counts as existing, and `realpathSync` on a dangling link
 * throws, which fails closed.
